# datchat
datchat is a dirt simple client/server chat application written in Java.  I wrote it because I was stuck using an 
terrible tool in an environment that did not support my needs, and I needed a basic reliable chat client.

datchat is written with a Swing front-end using a basic model-view-controller implementation for both the server and client applications.  Currently it is expected that both client and server will be run in GUI mode, but a command-line version of either is easily doable.
