# datchat
datchat is a dirt simple client/server chat application written in Java.  I wrote it because I was stuck using an 
terrible tool in an environment that did not support my needs, and I needed a basic reliable chat client.

datchat is written with a Swing front-end using a basic model-view-controller implementation for both the server and client applications.  Currently it is expected that both client and server will be run in GUI mode, but a command-line version of each is easily doable and planned before development is considered to be complete.

#thanks
As you can see datchat was forked from this project:  https://github.com/Blackbird93/Chat

Github is awesome right?  I am very thankful for this start - this project was exactly what I needed: short and functional.  I could read the whole thing in ten minutes, and as a bonus it worked fairly well so I was able to start with a known good project and take it forward.  Thanks Blackbird93.
