# datchat
datchat is a dirt simple chat client/server app in Java.  I wrote it because I was stuck using an 
terrible tool in an environment that did not support my needs.

#thanks
As you can see it is forked from this project:  https://github.com/Blackbird93/Chat

Github is awesome right?  I am very thankful for this start - this project was exactly what I needed: short and functional.  I read the whole thing in ten minutes, and as a bonus it worked so I was able to start with a known good project and take it forward.  Thanks Blackbird93.
